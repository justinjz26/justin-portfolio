    "I am a senior undergraduate student in Robotics at the University of Michigan. My research interests include soft robotics, wearable electronics, and functional materials for robotics. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in the Soft Machines Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in how the composition and structure of soft and functional materials, including liquid metals, stretchable conductors, battery materials, and soft composites, can be designed to create robotic systems that sense, actuate, and interact safely with the physical world. My goal is to develop robotic systems that are soft, adaptive, and safe for close human interaction."
